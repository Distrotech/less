The Less License, in the file LICENSE.\r\n\r\n    Please report any problems to bug-less@gnu.org.\r\n    See http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less for the latest info.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================\r\n\r\nThis is the distribution of \"less\", a paginator similar to \"more\" or \"pg\".\r\n\r\nThe formatted manual page is in less.man.\r\nThe manual page nroff source is in less.nro.\r\nMajor changes made since the last posted version are in NEWS.\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION (Unix systems only):\r\n\r\n1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and unpack it,\r\n   if you have not already done so.  \r\n\r\n2. Type \"sh configure\".\r\n   This will generate a Makefile and a defines.h.\r\n   Warning: if you have a GNU sed, make sure it is version 2.05 or later.\r\n\r\n   The file INSTALL describes the usage of the configure program in\r\n   general.  In addition, these options to configure are supported:\r\n\r\n   --with-editor=program\r\n     Specifies the default editor program used by the \"v\" command.\r\n     The default is \"vi\".\r\n\r\n   --with-regex=lib\r\n     Specifies the regular expression library used by less for pattern\r\n     matching.  The default is \"auto\", which means the configure program \r\n     finds a regular expression library automatically.  Other values are:\r\n        posix          Use the POSIX-compatible regcomp.\r\n        pcre           Use the PCRE library.\r\n        regcmp         Use the regcmp library.\r\n        re_comp        Use the re_comp library.\r\n        regcomp        Use the V8-compatible regcomp.\r\n        regcomp-local  Use Henry Spencer's V8-compatible regcomp\r\n                       (source is supplied with less).\r\n        none           No regular expressions, only simple string matching.\r\n   --with-secure\r\n     Builds a \"secure\" version of less, with some features disabled\r\n     to prevent users from viewing other files, accessing shell\r\n     commands, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. It is a good idea to look over the generated Makefile and defines.h\r\n   and make sure they look ok.  If you know of any peculiarities of\r\n   your system that configure might not have detected, you may fix the\r\n   Makefile now.  Take particular notice of the list of \"terminal\" \r\n   libraries in the LIBS definition in the Makefile; these may need \r\n   to be edited.  The terminal libraries will be some subset of\r\n       -lncurses  -lcurses  -ltermcap  -ltermlib\r\n\r\n   If you wish, you may edit defines.h to remove some optional features.\r\n   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may\r\n   wish to edit the manual page \"less.nro\" and the help page \"less.hlp\" \r\n   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.\r\n   If you edit less.hlp, you should run \"make -f Makefile.aut help.c\".\r\n\r\n4. Type \"make\" and watch the fun.\r\n\r\n5. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs \"less\",\r\n   \"lesskey\" and \"lessecho\" in your current directory.  Test the \r\n   generated programs.\r\n\r\n6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it\r\n   in a public place, type \"make install\".\r\n\r\n   The default install destinations are:\r\n        Executables (less, lesskey, lessecho) in /usr/local/bin\r\n        Documentation (less.nro, lesskey.nro) in /usr/local/man/man1\r\n   If you want to install any of these files elsewhere, define\r\n   bindir and/or mandir to the appropriate directories.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems building or running \"less\", suggestions, \r\ncomplaints, etc., you may mail to bug-less@gnu.org.\r\n\r\nNote to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed\r\nin double curly brackets {{ like this }}.\r\n\r\n(Note that the above note was originally written at a time when \r\n\"hackers\" most commonly meant \"enthusiastic and dedicated computer \r\nprogrammers\", not \"persons who attempt to circumvent computer security\".)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION (MS-DOS systems only,\r\n              with Microsoft C, Borland C, or DJGPP)\r\n\r\n1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.\r\n   Depending on your compiler, you may need to convert the source \r\n   to have CR-LF rather than LF as line terminators.\r\n\r\n2. If you are using Microsoft C, rename MAKEFILE.DSU to MAKEFILE.\r\n   If you are using Borland C, rename MAKEFILE.DSB to MAKEFILE.\r\n   If you are using DJGPP, rename MAKEFILE.DSG to MAKEFILE.\r\n\r\n3. Look at MAKEFILE to make sure that the definitions for CC and LIBDIR\r\n   are correct.  CC should be the name of your C compiler and\r\n   LIBDIR should be the directory where the C libraries reside (for\r\n   Microsoft C only).  If these definitions need to be changed, you can\r\n   either modify the definitions directly in MAKEFILE, or set your\r\n   environment variables CC and/or LIBDIR to override the definitions\r\n   in MAKEFILE.\r\n\r\n4. If you wish, you may edit DEFINES.DS to remove some optional features.\r\n   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may\r\n   wish to edit the manual page LESS.MAN and the help page HELP.C\r\n   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.\r\n\r\n5. Run your \"make\" program and watch the fun.\r\n   If your \"make\" requires a flag to import environment variables,\r\n   you should use that flag.\r\n   If your compiler runs out of memory, try running \"make -n >cmds.bat\" \r\n   and then run cmds.bat.\r\n\r\n6. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs \"LESS.EXE\" and\r\n   \"LESSKEY.EXE\" in your current directory.  Test the generated programs.\r\n\r\n7. When satisfied that it works, you may wish to install LESS.EXE and\r\n   LESSKEY.EXE in a directory which is included in your PATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION (Windows-95, Windows-98 and Windows-NT systems only,\r\n              with Borland C or Microsoft Visual C++)\r\n\r\n1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.\r\n\r\n2. If you are using Borland C, rename Makefile.wnb to Makefile.\r\n   If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, rename Makefile.wnm to Makefile.\r\n\r\n3. Check the Makefile to make sure the definitions look ok.\r\n\r\n4. If you wish, you may edit defines.wn to remove some optional features.\r\n   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may\r\n   wish to edit the manual page less.man and the help page help.c\r\n   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.\r\n\r\n5. Type \"make\" and watch the fun.\r\n\r\n6. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs \"less.exe\" and\r\n   \"lesskey.exe\" in your current directory.  Test the generated programs.\r\n\r\n7. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it\r\n   in a public place, type \"make install\".\r\n   See step 6 of the Unix installation instructions for details\r\n   on how to change the default installation directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION (OS/2 systems only,\r\n              with EMX C)\r\n\r\n1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.\r\n\r\n2. Rename Makefile.o2e to Makefile.\r\n\r\n3. Check the Makefile to make sure the definitions look ok.\r\n\r\n4. If you wish, you may edit defines.o2 to remove some optional features.\r\n   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may\r\n   wish to edit the manual page less.man and the help page help.c\r\n   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.\r\n\r\n5. Type \"make\" and watch the fun.\r\n\r\n6. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs \"less.exe\" and\r\n   \"lesskey.exe\" in your current directory.  Test the generated programs.\r\n\r\n7. Make sure you have the emx runtime installed. You need the emx DLLs\r\n   emx.dll and emxlibcs.dll and also the termcap database, termcap.dat.\r\n   Make sure you have termcap.dat either in the default location or\r\n   somewhere in a directory listed in the PATH or INIT environment \r\n   variables.\r\n\r\n8. When satisfied that it works, you may wish to install less.exe,\r\n   lesskey.exe and scrsize.exe in a directory which is included in \r\n   your PATH.  scrsize.exe is required only if you use a terminal\r\n   emulator such as xterm or rxvt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION (OS-9 systems only,\r\n              with Microware C or Ultra C)\r\n\r\n1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.\r\n\r\n2. If you are using Microware C, rename Makefile.o9c to Makefile.\r\n   If you are using Ultra C, rename Makefile.o9u to Makefile.\r\n\r\n3. Check the Makefile to make sure the definitions look ok.\r\n\r\n4. If you wish, you may edit defines.o9 to remove some optional features.\r\n   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may\r\n   wish to edit the manual page less.man and the help page help.c\r\n   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.\r\n\r\n5. Type \"dmake\" and watch the fun.\r\n   The standard OS-9 \"make\" will probably not work.  If you don't\r\n   have dmake, you can get a copy from os9archive.rtsi.com.\r\n\r\n6. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs \"less\" and\r\n   \"lesskey\" in your current directory.  Test the generated programs.\r\n\r\n7. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it\r\n   in a public place, type \"dmake install\".\r\n   See step 6 of the Unix installation instructions for details\r\n   on how to change the default installation directories.\r\n\r\n=======================================================================\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS:\r\n  Some versions of the less distribution are packaged using \r\n  Info-ZIP's compression utility.\r\n  Info-ZIP's software is free and can be obtained as source \r\n  code or executables from various anonymous-ftp sites,\r\n  including ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
